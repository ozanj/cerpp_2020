# Motivation
## Policy discourse about access to public research universities

The problem: access to public research universities
- Historical mission of social mobility for meritorious state residents
- Concern about growing socioeconomic and racial inequality in access
<br>
Mainstream policy discourse about access: The 2014 White House "Access Summit" 
- `r citet(bib['RN4016'])` review of causes of unequal college access
    - "achievement gap", "under-matching"; place responsibility on students, K-12 schools
    - affordability; declining state support leads to rising tuition prices
- `r citet(bib['RN4017'])` asks universities for *Commitments to Action on College Opportunity*
    - Universities pledge "action plans" (e.g., need-based financial aid, "outreach", holistic admission)

<br>
Problem with policy discourse: does not interrogate university enrollment priorities
- Applauds universities for commitment to access despite "deficiencies" of students and K-12 schools, despite declines in state funding
- Decades of research finds policy adoption a symbolic effort to appease stakeholders `r cite(bib['RN2436'])`

---

# Motivation
## Analyze recruiting to understand university enrollment priorities

Alternative explanation for access inequality
- University enrollment priorities biased against poor students and/or communities of color

Why study university recruiting behavior
- Universities expend substantial resources identifying and recruiting prospects `r citep(bib['RN4402'])`
- Internal resource allocation better indicator of organizational priorities than rhetoric, policies
- Knowing which student populations targeted by recruiting efforts indicates enrollment priorities

Research focus
- Analyze off-campus recruiting visits (e.g., visit to a local high school) by public research universities as a means of gaining insight about university enrollment priorities
- **Research question**
    - What are the similarities and differences in off-campus recruiting patterns across universities?
- **Analytic focus**
    - Income; race; academic achievement; in-state vs. out-of-state

# Background
## The enrollment management industry

*** =left

**The enrollment funnel**

<img src="assets/images/funnel.png" alt="Enrollment Funnel" style="width:80%;float:left;">

*** =right

**Interventions along the funnel**
* Identify prospects
    - Buy "student lists" from College Board/ACT
* Recruit prospects remotely
    * Email, mail, text, etc.
* Recruit prospects in-person
    * **Off-campus recruiting visits** (e.g., high school visits, college fairs)
    * Campus visits
    * Other "outreach"
* Solicit inquiries, stealth applicants
    * Social media, advertising
* Convert admits to enrollees
    * Financial aid leveraging
