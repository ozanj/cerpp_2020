# Motivation
## Policy discourse on college access inequality

The 2014 White House "Access Summit" 
- `r citet(bib['RN4016'])` review of causes of unequal college access
    - "achievement gap", "under-matching"; place responsibility on students, K-12 schools
- `r citet(bib['RN4017'])` asks universities for *Commitments to Action on College Opportunity*
    - Universities pledge "action plans" (e.g., need-based financial aid, "outreach", holistic admission)
    - "Despite state disinvestment and student deficiencies, we care about access more than ever"

<br>
Why study marketing, recruiting
- Universities expend substantial resources identifying, recruiting prospects
- Internal resource allocation better indicator of organizational priorities than rhetoric, policies
- Knowing which student populations targeted by recruiting efforts indicates enrollment priorities

<br>
Enrollment management is an opaque industry
- Research goal: document concrete EM behaviors, so that this can be part of policy discussion

--- 

# Motivation
## Why study recruiting

Alternative explanation for access inequality
- University enrollment priorities biased against poor students and/or communities of color

Why study university recruiting behavior
- Universities expend substantial resources identifying and recruiting prospects `r citep(bib['RN4402'])`
- Internal resource allocation better indicator of organizational priorities than rhetoric, policies
- Knowing which student populations targeted by recruiting efforts indicates enrollment priorities

Research focus
- Analyze off-campus recruiting visits (e.g., visit to a local high school) by public research universities as a means of gaining insight about university enrollment priorities
- **Research question**
    - What are the similarities and differences in off-campus recruiting patterns across universities?
- **Analytic focus**
    - Income; race; academic achievement; in-state vs. out-of-state


--- &twocol

# Motivation
## The "enrollment funnel"

*** =left

<img src="assets/images/funnel.png" alt="Enrollment Funnel" style="width:90%;float:left;">

*** =right

**Interventions along the funnel**
* Identify prospects
    - Buy "student lists" from College Board/ACT
* Recruit prospects remotely
    * Email, mail, text, etc.
* Recruit prospects in-person
    * **Off-campus recruiting visits** (e.g., high school visits, college fairs)
    * Campus visits
    * Other "outreach"
* Solicit inquiries, stealth applicants
    * Social media, advertising
* Convert admits to enrollees
    * Financial aid leveraging

# Conceptual Framing
## The sieve and the market

<!--
functions of higher education: "sieve," "incubator," "temple," and "hub"

<br>
Under "national service," the sieve serves redistribution. Under "market," sieve serves reproduction

-->

The "sieve" function of higher education `r citep(bib['RN2377'])`
- Higher education allocates people to different occupational/social positions
- Dual character of education [CITE WEBER], simultaneously serves
    - Social mobility: redistributing access to privileged positions
    - Social reproduction: privileged families get access to universities that confer the best positions
    
<br>
Political economy of US higher education citep(bib['RN4517'])`:
- "National service" configuration
    - Expansion of federal and state investment in higher ed
    - Creation of state higher education systems
- "Market" configuration
    - Demographic contraction; state disinvestment
    - Transportation, technology advances, national guidebooks and rankings create national market

# Conceptual Framing
## The political economy of enrollment management

*** =left

**Iron triangle of enrollment management**

<img src="assets/images/iron_triangle.png" alt="Enrollment Funnel" style="width:80%;float:left;">

*** =right

**"National service" political economy**
* Universities as civil service orgs
    - State demands human capital development, equality of opportunity
* University enrollment goals
    - Access; academic quality
* The "sieve" serves
    - Mobility and reproduction

<br>

**"Market" political economy**
* Universities as self-interested corporations
* University enrollment goals
    - Revenue; academic quality (rankings)
* The "sieve" serves
    - Social reproduction (paying customers)
