<!--

- Universities expend substantial resources identifying, recruiting prospects `r citep(bib['RN4402'])`

- University rhetoric: 
- "Despite state disinvestment and student deficiencies, we care about access 

- Universities expend substantial resources identifying, recruiting prospects


# Motivation
## Why study recruiting

Alternative explanation for access inequality
- University enrollment priorities biased against poor students and/or communities of color

Why study university recruiting behavior
- Universities expend substantial resources identifying and recruiting prospects `r citep(bib['RN4402'])`
- Internal resource allocation better indicator of organizational priorities than rhetoric, policies
- Knowing which student populations targeted by recruiting efforts indicates enrollment priorities

Research focus
- Analyze off-campus recruiting visits (e.g., visit to a local high school) by public research universities as a means of gaining insight about university enrollment priorities
- **Research question**
    - What are the similarities and differences in off-campus recruiting patterns across universities?
- **Analytic focus**
    - Income; race; academic achievement; in-state vs. out-of-state

-->

# Motivation
## Policy discourse on college access inequality

The 2014 White House "Access Summit" 
- `r citet(bib['RN4016'])` reviews causes of access inequality
    - Demand-side explanations; e.g., "achievement gap", "under-matching"
    - Place responsibility on students, K-12 schools
- `r citet(bib['RN4017'])` asks universities for *Commitments to Action on College Opportunity*
    - Universities pledge "action plans" (e.g., need-based financial aid, "outreach", holistic admission)


<br>
Why study marketing, recruiting
- Enrollment management is an opaque industry
    - Rhetoric: "despite state disinvestment (and student deficiences), we care about access"
- Internal resource allocation better indicator of organizational priorities than rhetoric, policies
- Knowing which student populations targeted by recruiting efforts indicates enrollment priorities

<br>
Research goal: 
- Document enrollment management behaviors, push policy discourse to consider supply-side

# Background
## The "enrollment funnel"

*** =left

<img src="assets/images/funnel.png" alt="Enrollment Funnel" style="width:90%;float:left;">

*** =right

**Interventions along the funnel**
* Identify prospects
    - e.g., buy "student lists"
* Recruit prospects remotely
    * Email, mail, text, etc.
* Recruit prospects in-person
    * **Off-campus visits** (e.g., schools, fairs)
    * On-campus visits
    * Other "outreach"
* Marketing/ads (inquiries, stealth applicants)
    * Search engine marketing
    * Social media marketing
    * Traditional advertising
* Convert admits to enrollees
    * e.g., financial aid leveraging

# Conceptual Framing
## The behavior of US universities, according to Mitchell Stevens

<!--
functions of higher education: "sieve," "incubator," "temple," and "hub"

<br>
Under "national service," the sieve serves redistribution. Under "market," sieve serves reproduction

-->

The "sieve" function of higher education `r citep(bib['RN2377'])`
- Higher education allocates people to different occupational/social positions
- Dual character of education `r citep(bib['RN1297'])`, simultaneously serves
    - Social mobility: redistributing access to privileged positions
    - Social reproduction: privileged families get access to universities that confer the best positions
    
<br>
Political economy of US higher education `r citep(bib['RN4517'])`:
- "National service" orientation
    - Expansion of federal and state investment in higher ed
    - Creation of state higher education systems
- "Market" orientation
    - Demographic contraction; state disinvestment
    - Transportation, technology advances, national guidebooks and rankings create national market

# Conceptual Framing
## The political economy of enrollment management

*** =left

**Iron triangle of enrollment management**

<br>
<img src="assets/images/iron_triangle.png" alt="Enrollment Funnel" style="width:80%;float:left;">

*** =right

**"National service" political economy**
* Universities as civil service orgs
    - State demands human capital development, equality of opportunity
* University enrollment goals
    - Access; academic quality
* The "sieve" serves
    - Mobility and reproduction

<br>

**"Market" political economy**
* Universities as self-interested corporations
* University enrollment goals
    - Revenue; academic quality (rankings)
* The "sieve" serves
    - Social reproduction (paying customers)

# Empirical context
## State funding and tuition revenue, sample institutions in 2016-17

# Empirical context
## Nonresident enrollment growth at public research universities

Effect of state appropriations on nonresident enrollment `r citep(bib['RN3753'])`
- Decline in state appropriations leads to nonresident enrollment growth
- *Not quite causal*

<br>

Nonresident enrollment growth and socioeconomic/racial composition `r citep(bib['RN3685'])`
- Growth in percent nonresident associated with decline in percent Pell, percent Black/Latinx
- *Descriptive*

<br>

Crowd out? Effect of nonresident enrollment on resident enrollment `r citep(bib['RN4290'])`
- No effect for population of public research; crowd out at prestigious public research
- *Plausibly causal*

<br>

Effect of resident and nonresident enrollment on faculty hiring `r citep(bib['RN4492'])`
- Nonresident enrollment has strong positive relationship with tenure-line faculty hiring
- *Not quite causal*

# Discussion
## A theory of change

Macro theory of change
- Transform national policy discourse about access to consider university enrollment behavior and the incentives universities face

<br>

Local theory of change
- Provide concrete data about university EM behavior to local actors committed to access
- Local actors use these data to demand substantive change


---

# Discussion
## The political economy of enrollment management

Mitchell Stevens says:

- Transformation from "national service" to "market" political economy
- The "sieve" serves social reproduction rather than social mobility

<br>

This is what happens when state cuts investment in public flagship universities 
- Increase nonresident enrollment; they pay 2X-3X more than residents
- Recruit in wealthy (predominantly white) parts of metropolitan areas
- Don't villify universities for focusing on paying customers; rational response to state disinvestment

<br>

How do we get out of vicious cycle

- What if instead of saying: "despite state cuts we care about access more than ever"
- Universities said this: "this is how enrollment priorities change when state funding shrinks"
- Then the question to politicians, society becomes
    - "Is this the higher education system we want?"
    - Or do we have will to increase block grants and increasing purchasing power of poor students?
